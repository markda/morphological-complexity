# morphological-complexity
A foolhardy attempt at _defining_ morphological complexity in UD treebanks.

Run code as:

```
python morphology_metrics.py treebank.conllu
```

Mathematical details of the metrics can be found in **metric-details.pdf** along with some discussion about what they do and do not capture. There's also some dicussion on why to use these at all and not something like WALS (World Atlas of Languague Structure).
